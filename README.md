##### flask_demo
I started on flask basics, I hope to get better

use `git clone https://github.com/James-Wachuka/flask_demo` to get the code
`cd` to `flask_demo` and activate the `venv` using `venv\Scripts\activate`
install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run the app:
`set FLASK_APP=hello.py`
`
